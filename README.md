Microsoft Stock (MSFT) PRICE FORCASTING USING PyTorch LSTM

Time series data captures a series of data points recorded at (usually) regular intervals. Many classical methods try to deal with Time Series data. In the last years, Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) models have become a very useful method when dealing with those types of data. In this project, we are going to forcast Microsot stock using lstm model and PyTorch.
